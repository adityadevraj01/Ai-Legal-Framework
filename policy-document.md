## 1. Executive Summary

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems now enable the creation and manipulation of video content with unprecedented realism, making it increasingly difficult for ordinary viewers to distinguish authentic footage from synthetic material. While these tools support creativity, education, and communication, the absence of clear disclosure standards for AI-generated and AI-altered videos creates serious risks to privacy, reputation, and public trust.

This document proposes a **Draft Regulatory Framework for Mandatory Disclosure of AI-Generated and AI-Altered Video Content**, establishing legal and procedural requirements for labeling and governing synthetic video media. The framework is designed to promote transparency, assign clear responsibility to key stakeholders, and preserve the integrity of public discourse while enabling beneficial innovation to flourish.

---

## 2. Background, Context, and Rationale

Recent advances in deep learning, generative models, and neural rendering have enabled the fabrication and alteration of videos that convincingly mimic real individuals, voices, and events. While these capabilities can be harnessed for legitimate purposes—including accessibility tools, entertainment, educational content, and creative expression—they also facilitate the spread of misleading information and enable impersonation of real persons.

The misuse of synthetic media, particularly "deepfakes," for political manipulation, financial fraud, harassment, and non-consensual intimate content has demonstrated how these technologies can undermine democratic debate and individual dignity. Without enforceable disclosure norms, viewers cannot reliably assess the authenticity of content they encounter, and institutions struggle to respond effectively to reputational harms, misinformation campaigns, and targeted abuse.

Against this backdrop, there exists a pressing need for a structured regulatory response that places transparency and accountability at the center of AI-enabled video ecosystems. This framework aims to align the responsibilities of content creators, digital platforms, and AI technology providers within a coherent set of obligations and safeguards.

---

## 3. Policy Objectives

The proposed framework pursues the following objectives:

- **Require clear and consistent disclosure** for AI-generated and AI-altered video content across all major digital distribution channels.

- **Protect individuals and institutions** from impersonation, identity misuse, and deceptive visual manipulation.

- **Strengthen public confidence** in digital communication, media institutions, and information systems.

- **Limit malicious or harmful applications** of synthetic media while preserving lawful and beneficial uses of AI technology.

- **Clarify the respective responsibilities** of content creators, distributors, digital intermediaries, and AI system providers.

---

## 4. Key Definitions

For the purposes of this framework:

**AI-Generated Video:** Video content produced entirely by an artificial intelligence system without direct real-world recording or human-captured footage.

**AI-Altered Video:** Video content that originates from real-world footage but has been significantly modified using AI techniques, including but not limited to face-swapping, voice synthesis, behavioral manipulation, or scene alteration.

**Synthetic Media:** Any audio-visual content that has been created or substantially modified using artificial intelligence to imitate real persons, events, or environments.

**Disclosure:** A clear, visible, and intelligible statement that informs viewers that the video content has been generated or materially altered using AI technology.

**Platform:** Any digital intermediary or service—including social media networks, video-hosting sites, content-sharing applications, or streaming services—that hosts, recommends, distributes, or otherwise enables access to video content.

---

## 5. Guiding Principles

### Transparency as a Fundamental Duty
Disclosure of AI-generated and AI-altered video content must be a mandatory requirement, not a voluntary practice or industry courtesy.

### Accountability by Design
Responsibility for the creation and distribution of synthetic media must be clearly assigned and shared among creators, platforms, and AI technology providers, with appropriate mechanisms for documentation and oversight.

### Proportional and Enabling Regulation
Regulatory measures should effectively prevent and penalize harmful uses of AI-generated content while preserving adequate space for research, innovation, creative expression, and educational applications.

### Respect for Human Rights and Dignity
Protection of privacy, informed consent, reputation, and human dignity must guide both rule-making and enforcement activities under this framework.

---

## 6. Core Policy Provisions

### 6.1 Mandatory Disclosure

All AI-generated and AI-altered video content distributed through digital channels must include a clearly visible on-screen label stating either:

- "This video is AI-generated"; **or**
- "This video contains AI-altered content."

The disclosure label must satisfy the following requirements:

- Be **easily visible and understandable** to a reasonable viewer.
- Be displayed **prominently at the beginning** of the video and/or remain present throughout playback.
- **Not be obscured, minimized, or styled** in a manner that could confuse or mislead viewers.
- Be provided in a **language appropriate** to the target audience and distribution channel.

### 6.2 Legal Status of Non-Disclosure

The distribution of synthetic video content without the required disclosure shall be treated as an **act of digital misrepresentation** and subject to legal consequences, except in clearly defined circumstances where exemptions apply (as outlined in Section 7). Non-compliance may result in content removal, civil liability, and in cases of malicious intent or significant harm, criminal penalties under applicable law.

### 6.3 Obligations of Digital Platforms

Platforms that host or distribute video content shall be required to:

1. **Provide user-facing tools** and clear processes that enable content creators to label AI-generated and AI-altered content easily and accurately.

2. **Deploy reasonable technical and procedural measures** to detect and flag undisclosed synthetic media, including but not limited to automated detection systems and user reporting mechanisms.

3. **Remove, restrict visibility of, or append corrective disclosures** to content that violates disclosure requirements within defined and reasonable timeframes.

4. **Publish periodic transparency reports** detailing their handling of synthetic media, including volume of flagged content, categories of violations, enforcement actions taken, and cooperation with regulatory authorities.

5. **Collaborate with law enforcement and regulatory agencies** in investigations involving harmful, fraudulent, or unlawful synthetic content.

6. **Implement age-appropriate safeguards and content filters** to protect minors from exposure to harmful synthetic media.

Persistent or systematic failure to fulfill these obligations shall attract regulatory penalties, which may include monetary fines, enhanced oversight requirements, or operational restrictions as determined by the competent authority.

### 6.4 Protection Against Non-Consensual and Harmful Use

Stronger safeguards and stricter penalties shall apply where synthetic video content:

- **Reproduces a person's face, voice, likeness, or identity** without their informed and documented consent.

- **Misrepresents public officials, candidates for public office, or private individuals** in ways that distort public understanding, decision-making, or electoral processes.

- **Causes or is reasonably likely to cause** reputational, psychological, emotional, or financial harm to identifiable individuals.

- **Targets women, children, ethnic or religious minorities, or other vulnerable or marginalized groups** for harassment, defamation, or exploitation.

- **Constitutes non-consensual intimate imagery or sexual content.**

Such conduct shall attract civil remedies including injunctive relief, damages, and corrective disclosures. In cases involving malicious intent, significant harm, or violation of criminal statutes, criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment may be imposed under applicable law.

---

## 7. Exceptions and Conditional Exemptions

Subject to appropriate safeguards, documentation, and regulatory oversight, limited exemptions from mandatory disclosure requirements may be considered for the following categories:

- **Academic or scientific research** that has received formal ethical approval from a recognized institutional review board or research ethics committee.

- **Activities carried out by competent government authorities** for legitimate national security purposes, lawful criminal investigation, or intelligence operations, subject to judicial oversight and human rights safeguards.

- **Clearly fictional, artistic, satirical, or parody content** where a reasonable and informed viewer would not be deceived about the synthetic nature of the content, and where appropriate contextual cues are provided.

**Important Limitation:** Even within these exempt categories, content created with malicious intent, designed to cause targeted harm, or deliberately structured to deceive the public shall not be protected and shall remain subject to disclosure requirements and legal penalties.

---

## 8. Enforcement and Implementation

This framework shall be implemented through coordinated action by:

- The designated **national authority** responsible for digital governance, information technology regulation, or telecommunications oversight.

- **Media and communications regulators** with jurisdiction over broadcasting, online content distribution, and platform accountability.

- **Cybercrime investigation units and law enforcement agencies** tasked with investigating digital offenses and protecting citizens from online harms.

- **Data protection authorities** responsible for privacy rights and personal data governance.

### Grievance Redressal Mechanism

A fast-track grievance mechanism shall be established to enable individuals to:

- Report undisclosed synthetic video content
- Seek rapid takedown or restriction where content is harmful or non-consensual
- Obtain timely information on the status and outcome of their complaints

---

## 9. Penalties and Compliance Mechanism

A graduated system of penalties is recommended to ensure proportionate enforcement:

### First Instance Violation
Formal warning, mandatory corrective disclosure, or content removal within specified timeframe.

### Repeated Violations
Monetary fines calibrated to the severity and scale of non-compliance, temporary suspension of user accounts, or restrictions on content posting privileges.

### Malicious or Harmful Misuse
Criminal liability under existing cybercrime, information technology, and criminal statutes, potentially including significant fines and/or imprisonment depending on the nature and impact of the offense.

### Platform Non-Compliance
Platforms exhibiting repeated or systematic non-compliance may be subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny, escalating fines, operational restrictions, or other sanctions deemed appropriate by the regulating authority.

---

## 10. Alignment with Existing Law

This framework is designed to operate in harmony with and provide support to existing legislation governing:

- Information technology, intermediary liability, and online content regulation
- Cybercrime, fraud, identity theft, and related offenses involving digital communication
- Data protection, privacy rights, and personal information processing
- Defamation, harassment, and reputation protection
- Consumer protection and unfair trade practices
- Electoral law and campaign finance regulation
- Intellectual property rights and licensing

Where conflicts or gaps arise, this framework should be interpreted in a manner that maximizes protection of individual rights while maintaining consistency with constitutional principles and international human rights obligations.

---

## 11. Governance, Monitoring, and Periodic Review

To ensure effective implementation and adaptive governance, a **multi-stakeholder oversight body** should be constituted, comprising representatives from:

- Youth representatives and civil society organizations focused on digital rights and media literacy
- Computer scientists, AI researchers, and technology experts
- Legal scholars, ethicists, and human rights advocates
- Media professionals, journalists, and fact-checking organizations
- Platform representatives and technology industry associations
- Government officials from relevant regulatory and law enforcement agencies

### Periodic Review

This framework should be reviewed and updated at regular intervals (recommended: every 18-24 months) to account for technological advancements, evolving threat landscapes, emerging best practices, and feedback from implementation experience. The oversight body should publish annual reports assessing the framework's effectiveness and recommending improvements.

## 12. Conclusion

AI-powered video technologies are fundamentally reshaping how societies create, share, interpret, and consume information. The benefits of these technologies are substantial and include enhanced creative expression, improved accessibility, educational innovation, and new forms of entertainment. However, their misuse—particularly when synthetic content circulates without clear disclosure—poses significant risks to individual reputations, institutional credibility, democratic processes, and social cohesion.

By establishing mandatory disclosure as a baseline expectation and clarifying the respective roles and responsibilities of content creators, digital platforms, AI developers, and regulatory authorities, this framework seeks to restore and maintain trust in digital media ecosystems while preserving space for continued innovation and beneficial applications of AI technology.

**The Student Global Summit respectfully submits this Draft Regulatory Framework for consideration by policymakers, regulatory authorities, and other stakeholders. We stand ready to support further consultation, refinement, stakeholder engagement, and practical implementation of these proposals.**
