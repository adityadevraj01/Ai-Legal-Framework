[![Student Global Summit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Organization-SG%20Summit-green.svg)](https://studentglobalsummit.com)

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive **Draft Regulatory Framework** for mandatory disclosure and oversight of AI-generated and AI-altered video content. The framework addresses the growing challenges posed by synthetic media technologies, commonly known as "deepfakes," and proposes concrete policy solutions to protect individuals and institutions while enabling beneficial innovation.

**Author:** Aditya Devraj Choudhary  
**Organization:** Student Global Summit (SG Summit) - Policy & Ethics Council  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Status:** Draft for Public Consultation

## 🎯 Purpose

As artificial intelligence enables increasingly realistic video synthesis and manipulation, the absence of clear disclosure standards creates serious risks to:

- **Privacy and consent** - Non-consensual use of personal likenesses
- **Reputation and dignity** - Defamation and impersonation
- **Public trust** - Misinformation in media and democratic processes
- **Individual safety** - Harassment and targeted abuse

This framework proposes mandatory disclosure requirements, platform obligations, enforcement mechanisms, and graduated penalties to address these challenges while preserving space for legitimate uses of AI technology.

1. **Executive Summary** - Overview and key recommendations
2. **Background, Context, and Rationale** - Problem statement and justification
3. **Policy Objectives** - Five core goals of the framework
4. **Key Definitions** - AI-Generated Video, AI-Altered Video, Synthetic Media, Disclosure, Platform
5. **Guiding Principles** - Transparency, accountability, proportionality, human rights
6. **Core Policy Provisions** - Mandatory disclosure, platform obligations, harm protection
7. **Exceptions and Conditional Exemptions** - Research, security, artistic content

## 🔑 Key Provisions

### Mandatory Disclosure Requirements

All AI-generated or AI-altered video content must include clear, visible labels:
- "This video is AI-generated"
- "This video contains AI-altered content"

Labels must be:
- ✅ Easily visible and understandable
- ✅ Displayed at the beginning or throughout playback
- ✅ Not obscured or designed to mislead
- ✅ In appropriate language for the audience

### Platform Obligations

Digital platforms must:
1. Provide tools for easy content labeling
2. Deploy detection systems for undisclosed synthetic media
3. Remove or restrict violating content within defined timelines
4. Publish transparency reports on enforcement actions
5. Collaborate with regulators and law enforcement
6. Implement safeguards to protect minors

### Protection Against Harmful Use

Stronger penalties apply when synthetic content:
- Reproduces identities without informed consent
- Misrepresents public officials or electoral processes
- Causes reputational, psychological, or financial harm
- Targets vulnerable groups for harassment
- Constitutes non-consensual intimate imagery

### Graduated Penalty System

- **First violation:** Warning and corrective action
- **Repeated violations:** Fines and account restrictions
- **Malicious misuse:** Criminal liability including imprisonment
- **Platform non-compliance:** Enhanced oversight and operational restrictions

## 🌍 Real-World Context

### The Problem

Recent examples of synthetic media misuse include:

- **Political manipulation** - Fabricated videos of candidates making false statements
- **Financial fraud** - Voice cloning used for CEO impersonation scams
- **Non-consensual intimate content** - Face-swapped explicit material
- **Defamation campaigns** - Synthetic videos damaging reputations
- **Electoral interference** - Misleading content during campaigns

### Current Regulatory Gap

Most jurisdictions lack:
- ✗ Mandatory disclosure requirements for synthetic content
- ✗ Clear platform accountability standards
- ✗ Enforcement mechanisms with teeth
- ✗ Protection for victims of deepfake abuse
- ✗ Balance between innovation and safety

This framework addresses these gaps systematically.
